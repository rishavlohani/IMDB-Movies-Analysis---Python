# IMDB-Movies-Analysis---Python
This repository inclued a dataset of movies to uncover insights into trends, genre popularity, and factors influencing success. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn), I explored relationships between budget, revenue, and ratings, providing a deeper understanding of movie performance across different genres and years.
The dataset includes the following columns:

names: Movie titles
date_x: Release dates
score: IMDB ratings
genre: Genres
overview: Movie summaries
crew: Cast and crew information
orig_title: Original titles
status: Release status (e.g., released, post-production)
orig_lang: Original language
budget_x: Production budgets
revenue: Box office revenues
country: Production country
